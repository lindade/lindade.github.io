# lindade.github.io

My Github portfolio page to showcase some of my projects. I designed the page and implementated it with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's based on Bootstrap 4. Try out the mobile and desktop view as the project section adapts its usability to optimise the user experience for different device sizes.
